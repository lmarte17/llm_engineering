Rather, I execute Jupyter Labs, like this, and give you an intuition for what's going on. My suggestion is that you do this with me, either at the same time, or (perhaps better) right afterwards. Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations. If you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations. Not only is this essential practice, but it demonstrates your skills to others, including perhaps future clients or employers...</span>\n",

We'll do fun things like have LLMs tell jokes and argue with each other. But fundamentally, my goal is to teach skills you can apply in business. I'll explain business implications as we go, and it's worth keeping this in mind: as you build experience with models and techniques, think of ways you could put this into action at work today. Please do contact me if you'd like to discuss more or if you have ideas to bounce off me.</span>\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Team Identification**: The substitution entries were inferred based on player names typically associated with each team. For example, Brandon Knight's surname (commonly associated with the Knicks) versus players like Anunoby and Hart (commonly associated with the Magic).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Minutes Calculation**: Minutes played were calculated based on the timestamps of substitutions. For instance, if a player starts the game and is subbed out at 03:03, they played 8 minutes and 57 seconds in Q1.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Incomplete Data for Orlando Magic**: The play-by-play provided lacks comprehensive substitution data for the Orlando Magic. Only a few substitutions could be inferred, and detailed minutes for all Magic players are not fully available.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Game Structure**: The data appears to cover aspects of the first quarter (Q1). Without information on Q2, Q3, and Q4, the minutes calculated are limited to the provided timeframe.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Conclusion**\n",
      "\n",
      "The above tables provide a detailed overview of player participation and substitutions for the **New York Knicks** based on the provided play-by-play data. The information for the **Orlando Magic** is limited due to incomplete substitution details. For a comprehensive analysis, including all quarters and Magic team substitutions, accessing the full game summary or official box score from NBA.com would be ideal.\n",
