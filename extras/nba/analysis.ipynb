He scored 25 points in 25 minutes in his first game back. He had 32 vs MIL earlier this season. He got up 18 shots in those 25 minutes but with D’Angelo Russell also in the picture, I wouldn’t be so sure he’s going to chuck as much as he did. Cam Johnson dropped down to 16.5 points. He averages 16.9 in games with Cam Thomas but this factors in him and Russell. MIL ranks 16th in spot up points allowed (21% of Cams points) and 25th in transition (20% of his points). Russell scored 22 in his Nets “debut”. He came off the bench but as of right now, he has a 14.5 point line. My best advice is to let him, Cam Thomas, and Cam Johnson marinate for a few games before trying to guess which guy is chucking tonight.\\n\\nGiannis has 30+ points in 6 of his last 7 games.

If Giannis and Dame both play, Middleton is under 15 points in 4 of 5 games with both of them playing. He scores 28% of his points from the pick game so he could struggle to generate points.
